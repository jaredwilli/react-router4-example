## Overview
_____

This is a bare bones React Router 4 example app that shows how to use the new version of the router and how routes are defined for child routes.

It's pretty basic and straight-forward. I intend to keep the dependencies up-to-date for this repository, at least for a little while. That way anyone looking for a WORKING example of react-router4, they will be able to see an actual working example that uses the most recent updates for dependencies.

You can see a demo of this at:
